## 2026-04-07 manual [pitfall]
Template placeholder expansion must trim results and collapse double spaces when placeholders resolve to empty strings

## 2026-04-07 manual [pitfall]
Do not add engine contract fields that have no implementation in the runtime converter - advertises behavior the system cannot deliver

## 2026-04-08 manual [pitfall]
Clock profiles for Slavic locales must set minuteGender (and hourGender) explicitly -- minutes are feminine in most Slavic languages and the engine defaults to masculine

## 2026-04-08 manual [pitfall]
Resolve grammatical suffix AFTER selecting the template path -- range-relative counts are wrong for default/bucket templates that use absolute minute values

## 2026-04-08 manual [pitfall]
Bucket templates (min5, min10, etc.) fire for ALL times at that minute value -- do not embed day-period words in bucket templates because the engine always appends day periods on top, causing contradictory double-period output

## 2026-04-08 manual [pitfall]
Day-period hour resolution must be template-aware: only shift to next-hour period when template references {nextHour} or {nextArticle}, not based on minute threshold alone
