# API Reference

The API reference is automatically generated from the `Humanizer` assembly and its XML documentation using DocFX.

Use the table of contents to explore namespaces, types, and members. Each page links back to the corresponding source when available.

The table of contents is generated automatically during the documentation build process and stays in sync with the codebase.
