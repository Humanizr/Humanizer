Humanizer is a small framework that helps .Net developer turn their otherwise geeky strings, type names, enum fields, date, timespan values into a human friendly format plus a lot more.

###Installation
You can install Humanizer as [a nuget package](https://nuget.org/packages/Humanizer): `Install-Package Humanizer`

###Humanize Strings
String extensions are at the heart of this micro-framework. The foundation of this was set in the [BDDfy framework](https://github.com/TestStack/TestStack.BDDfy) where class names, method names and properties are turned into human readable sentences. 

```C#
"PascalCaseInputStringIsTurnedIntoSentence".Humanize() => "Pascal case input string is turned into sentence"
    
"Underscored_input_string_is_turned_into_sentence".Humanize() => "Underscored input string is turned into sentence"
    
"Underscored_input_String_is_turned_INTO_sentence".Humanize() => "Underscored input String is turned INTO sentence"
    
// acronyms are left intact
"HTML".Humanize() => "HTML" 
```

You may also specify the desired letter casing:

```C#
"CanReturnTitleCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.Title) => "Can Return Title Case"
    
"Can_return_title_Case".Humanize(LetterCasing.Title) => "Can Return Title Case"
    
"CanReturnLowerCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.LowerCase) => "can return lower case"
    
"CanHumanizeIntoUpperCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.AllCaps) => "CAN HUMANIZE INTO UPPER CASE"
```

 > The `LetterCasing` API and the methods accepting it are legacy from V0.2 era and will be deprecated in the future. Instead of that, you can use `Transform` method explained below.

####Dehumanize Strings
Much like you can humanize a computer friendly into human friendly string you can dehumanize a human friendly string into a computer friendly one:

```C#
"Pascal case input string is turned into sentence".Dehumanize() => "PascalCaseInputStringIsTurnedIntoSentence"
```

###Transform
There is a `Transform` method that supercedes `LetterCasing`, `ApplyCase` and `Humanize` overloads that accept `LetterCasing`. 
Transform method signatue is as follows:

```C#
string Transform(this string input, params IStringTransformer[] transformers)
```

And there are some out of the box implemenations of `IStringTransformer` for letter casing:

```C#
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.LowerCase) => "sentence casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.SentenceCase) => "Sentence casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.TitleCase) => "Sentence Casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.UpperCase) => "SENTENCE CASING"
```

`LowerCase` is a public static property on `To` class that returns an instance of private `ToLowerCase` class that implements `IStringTransformer` and knows how to turn a string into lower case.

The benefit of using `Transform` and `IStringTransformer` over `ApplyCase` and `LetterCasing` is that `LetterCasing` is an enum and you're limited to use what's in the framework
while `IStringTransformer` is an interface you can implement in your codebase once and use it with `Transform` method allowing for easy extension. 

###Humanize Enums
Calling `ToString` directly on enum members usually results in less than ideal output for users. The solution to this is usually to use `DescriptionAttribute` data annotation and then read that at runtime to get a more friendly output. That is a great solution; but more often than not we only need to put some space between words of an enum member - which is what `String.Humanize()` does well. For an enum like:

```C#
public enum EnumUnderTest
{
    [Description("Custom description")]
    MemberWithDescriptionAttribute,
    MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute,
    ALLCAPITALS
}
```

You will get:

```C#
// DescriptionAttribute is honored
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithDescriptionAttribute.Humanize() => "Custom description"
    
// In the absence of Description attribute string.Humanizer kicks in
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute.Humanize() => "Member without description attribute" 
    
// Of course you can still apply letter casing 
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute.Humanize().Transform(To.TitleCase) => "Member Without Description Attribute"
```

Hopefully this will help avoid littering enums with unnecessary attributes!

####Dehumanize Enums
Dehumanizes a string into the Enum it was originally Humanized from! The API looks like:

```C#
public static Enum DehumanizeTo<TTargetEnum>(this string input) 
```

And the usage is:

```C#
"Member without description attribute".Dehumanize() => EnumUnderTest.MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute
```

And just like the Humanize API it honors the `Description` attribute. You don't have to provide the casing you provided during humanization: it figures it out.

###Humanize Dates
This is borrowed from [StackOverFlow algorithm](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12/141101) - although I had to apply some minor fixes on top of it. I am not going to bore you with all the examples as I am sure you know what this does: you basically give it an instance of `DateTime` and get back a string telling how far back in time that is:

```C#
DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(-30).Humanize() => "yesterday"
```

Humanizer supports local as well as UTC dates. You could also provide the date you want the input date to be compared against. If null, it will use the current date as comparison base. Here is the API signature:

```C#
public static string Humanize(this DateTime input, bool utcDate = true, DateTime? dateToCompareAgainst = null)
```

For dates Humanizer also supports localization.

**No dehumanization for dates as the human friendly date is not reversible**

###Humanizer TimeSpan
You can call `Humanizes` on a `TimeSpan` to a get human friendly representation for it:

```C#
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1).Humanize() => "1 millisecond"
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(2).Humanize() => "2 milliseconds"
TimeSpan.FromDays(1).Humanize() => "1 day"
TimeSpan.FromDays(14).Humanize() => "2 weeks"
```

###Inflector methods
There are also a few inflector methods:

 * Pluralize: pluralizes the provided input considering irregular words; e.g. `"Man".Pluralize()` => `"Men"` & `"string".Pluralize()` => `"strings"`
 * Singularize: singularizes the provided input considering irregular words; e.g. `"Men".Singularize()` => `"Man"` & `"strings".Singularize()` => `"string"`
 * Ordinalize numbers: turns a number into an ordinal string used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th; e.g. `1.Ordinalize()` => `"1st"`, `5.Ordinalize()` => `"5th"`
 * Ordinalize strings: Turns a number into an ordinal number used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th; e.g. `"21".Ordinalize()` => `"21st"`
 * Underscore: separates the input words with underscore; e.g. `"SomeTitle".Underscore()` => `"some_title"`
 * Dasherize: replaces underscores with dashes in the string; e.g. `"some_title".Dasherize()` => `"some-title"`

###Fluent Date
Humanizer provides a fluent API to deal with `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` as follows:

`TimeSpan` methods:

```C#
2.Milliseconds() => TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(2)
2.Seconds() => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)
2.Minutes() => TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)
2.Hours() => TimeSpan.FromHours(2)
2.Days() => TimeSpan.FromDays(2)
2.Weeks() => TimeSpan.FromDays(14)
```

<small>There are no fluent APIs for month or year as a month could have between 28 to 31 days and a year could be 365 or 366 days.</small>

You could use these methods to, for example, replace
 
```C#
DateTime.Now.AddDays(2).AddHours(3).AddMinutes(-5)
```

with 

```C#
DateTime.Now + 2.Days() + 3.Hours() - 5.Minutes()
```

There are also fluent methods to deal with `DateTime`:

```C#
In.TheYear(2010) // Returns the first of January of 2010
In.January // Returns 1st of January of the current year
In.FebruaryOf(2009) // Returns 1st of February of 2009
In.One.Second //  DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(1);
In.Two.SecondsFrom(DateTime dateTime)
In.Three.Minutes // With corresponding From method
In.Three.Hours // With corresponding From method
In.Three.Days // With corresponding From method
In.Three.Weeks // With corresponding From method
In.Three.Months // With corresponding From method
In.Three.Years // With corresponding From method
On.January.The4th // Returns 4th of January of the current year
On.February.The(12) // Returns 12th of Feb of the current year
```

and some extension methods:

```C#
var someDateTime = new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 5, 25, 45, 125);

// Returns new DateTime(2008, 2, 10, 5, 25, 45, 125) changing the year to 2008
someDateTime.In(2008) 

// Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 2, 25, 45, 125) changing the hour to 2:25:45.125
someDateTime.At(2) 

// Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 2, 20, 15, 125) changing the time to 2:20:15.125
someDateTime.At(2, 20, 15) 

// Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 12, 0, 0) changing the time to 12:00:00.000
someDateTime.AtNoon() 

// Returns new DateTime(2011, 2, 10, 0, 0, 0) changing the time to 00:00:00.000
someDateTime.AtMidnight() 
```

Obviously you could chain the methods too; e.g. `On.November.The13th.In(2010).AtNoon + 5.Minutes()`

###Number to words 
Humanizer can change numbers to words using the `ToWords` extension:

```C#
1.ToWords() => "one"
10.ToWords() => "ten"
11.ToWords() => "eleven"
122.ToWords() => "one hundred and twenty-two"
3501.ToWords() => "three thousand five hundred and one"
```

###Number to ordinal words
This is kind of mixing `ToWords` with `Ordinalize`. You can call `ToOrdinalWords` on a number to get an ordinal representation of the number in words!! Let me show that with an example:

```C#
0.ToOrdinalWords() => "zeroth"
1.ToOrdinalWords() => "first"
2.ToOrdinalWords() => "second"
8.ToOrdinalWords() => "eighth"
10.ToOrdinalWords() => "tenth"
11.ToOrdinalWords() => "eleventh"
12.ToOrdinalWords() => "twelfth"
20.ToOrdinalWords() => "twentieth"
21.ToOrdinalWords() => "twenty first"
121.ToOrdinalWords() => "hundred and twenty first"
```

###Mix this into your framework to simplify your life
This is just a baseline and you can use this to simplify your day to day job. For example, in Asp.Net MVC we keep chucking `Display` attribute on ViewModel properties so `HtmlHelper` can generate correct labels for us; but, just like enums, in vast majority of cases we just need a space between the words in property name - so why not use string.Humanizer for that?! 

You may find an Asp.Net MVC sample [in the code](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/tree/master/src/Humanizer.MvcSample) that does that (although the project is excluded from the solution file to make the nuget package available for .Net 3.5 too). 

This is achieved using a custom `DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider` I called [HumanizerMetadataProvider](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer.MvcSample/HumanizerMetadataProvider.cs). It is small enough to repeat here; so here we go:

```C#
public class HumanizerMetadataProvider : DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider
{
    protected override ModelMetadata CreateMetadata(
        IEnumerable<Attribute> attributes,
        Type containerType,
        Func<object> modelAccessor,
        Type modelType,
        string propertyName)
    {
        var propertyAttributes = attributes.ToList();
        var modelMetadata = base.CreateMetadata(propertyAttributes, containerType, modelAccessor, modelType, propertyName);
    
        if (IsTransformRequired(modelMetadata, propertyAttributes))
            modelMetadata.DisplayName = modelMetadata.PropertyName.Humanize();
    
        return modelMetadata;
    }
    
    private static bool IsTransformRequired(ModelMetadata modelMetadata, IList<Attribute> propertyAttributes)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(modelMetadata.PropertyName))
            return false;
    
        if (propertyAttributes.OfType<DisplayNameAttribute>().Any())
            return false;
    
        if (propertyAttributes.OfType<DisplayAttribute>().Any())
            return false;
    
        return true;
    }
}
```

This class calls the base class to extract the metadata and then, if required, humanizes the property name. It is checking if the property already has a `DisplayName` or `Display` attribute on it in which case the metadata provider will just honor the attribute and leave the property alone. For other properties it will Humanize the property name. That is all.

Now I need to register this metadata provider with Asp.Net MVC:

```C#
ModelMetadataProviders.Current = new HumanizerMetadataProvider();
```

... and now I can replace:

```C#
public class RegisterModel
{
    [Display(Name = "User name")]
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    
    [Display(Name = "Email address")]
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    
    [Display(Name = "Confirm password")]
    public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
}
```

with:

```C#
public class RegisterModel
{
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
}
```

... and the "metadata humanizer" will take care of the rest.

No need to mention that if you want title casing for your labels you may call the other overload of `Humanize` method:

```C#
modelMetadata.DisplayName = modelMetadata.PropertyName.Humanize().Transform(To.TitleCase);
```

##How to contribute?
Your contribution to Humanizer would be very welcome. Just check out the list of [issues](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/issues). They should be relatively straightforward. 
We us [GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) for pull requests. 
So if you want to contribute, fork the repo, fix an issue and send a PR.

One area Humanizer could definitely use your help is localisation. 
Currently Humanizer [supports](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/tree/master/src/Humanizer/Properties) French, Belgium, Spanish, Greek, German, Arabic, Russian and Romanian languages for `Date.Humanize` method. 
Humanizer could definitely do with more translations. We also need localization for `TimeSpan.Humanize`.

To add a translation, fork the repository if you haven't done yet, duplicate the [resources.resx](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer/Properties/Resources.resx) file, add your target [locale code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh441729.aspx) to the end (e.g. resources.ru.resx for Russian), translate the values to your language, commit, and send a pull request for it. Thanks.

Some languages have complex rules when it comes to dealing with numbers; for example, in Romanian "5 days" is "5 zile", while "24 days" is "24 de zile" and in Arabic "2 days" is "يومين" not "2 يوم".
Obviously a normal resource file doesn't cut it in these cases as a more complex mapping is required.
In cases like this in addition to creating a resource file you should also subclass [`DefaultFormatter`](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer/Localisation/DefaultFormatter.cs) in a class that represents your language; 
e.g. [RomanianFormatter](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer/Localisation/RomanianFormatter.cs) and then override the methods that need involve the complex rules. We think overriding the `GetResourceKey` method should be enough. To see how to do that check out RomanianFormatter and `RussianFormatter` to see an example. 
Then you return an instance of your class in the [Configurator](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer/Configuration/Configurator.cs) class in the getter of the [Formatter property](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/blob/master/src/Humanizer/Configuration/Configurator.cs#L11) based on the current culture.

### Building & running the Tests
You can build the whole solution, run the tests and create a local nuget package for the library by running the `go.cmd` on the root of the repo.
