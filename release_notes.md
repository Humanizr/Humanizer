###v1.6.1 - 2014-01-27
  - [#69](https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer/pull/69): changed the return type of `DehumanizeTo<TTargetEnum>` to `TTargetEnum`

####Potential breaking change
The return type of `DehumanizeTo<TTargetEnum>` was changed from `Enum` to `TTargetEnum` to make the API a lot easier to work with.
That also potentially means that your calls to the old method may be broken.
Depending on how you were using the method you might have to either drop the now redundant cast to `TTargetEnum` in your code, or
fix it based on your requirements.
